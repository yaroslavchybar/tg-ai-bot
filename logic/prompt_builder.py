GREETING DETECTION:
- Is this early conversation (first 3-5 messages)?
- Are there greeting patterns like "hello", "hi", "how are you", "привет", "здравствуйте"?
- Is the user just getting to know you?

CONVERSATION STAGE:
- Has rapport been established?
- Is the conversation flowing naturally?
- Is the user engaged and sharing?

MOOD & ENGAGEMENT:
- Is the user responsive and curious?
- Do they seem tired, distracted, or emotional?
- Is the topic light and casual?

TIMING RULES:
- SKIP if greetings or early conversation (build rapport first)
- SKIP if user seems disengaged or emotional
- ASK only when conversation is flowing naturally and user is engaged

Return only one word:
- "ASK" if perfect timing and mood for personal questions
- "SKIP" if greetings, too early, or mood/timing not right

# ================== DATABASE SERVICE PROMPTS ==================

FACT_UPDATE_PROMPT = """You are a Fact Database Manager.

Compare the user's message to the existing facts and decide which to ADD, UPDATE, or DELETE.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array (no text, no comments).

Each item must be one of:
{ "action": "ADD", "fact_type": "string", "value": "string" }
{ "action": "UPDATE", "fact_type": "string", "old_value": "string", "new_value": "string" }
{ "action": "DELETE", "fact_type": "string" }

If no clear action, return [].

---

Supported fact types:
["name","age","location","hobbies","activities","free_time","social","relationships",
"social_activities","work_studies","career_goals","learning","routine","sleep","eating",
"food_preferences","music","entertainment","future_plans","dreams","satisfaction"]

---

Rules:

- ADD → use only if a **new fact type not present** in existing_facts.
- UPDATE → only if **that fact_type already exists** in existing_facts.
- DELETE → message negates or rejects an existing fact.
- CONFIRMATION (e.g., “люблю”, “нравится”, “интересуюсь”, “занимаюсь”, “играю в”) → reaffirms existing fact → return [].
- Match meaning, not wording.
- If unsure or ambiguous → return [].
- Never use UPDATE with an empty old_value.
- Be minimal — one action per clear intent.

Negation patterns for DELETE:
["не люблю","не нравится","больше не","перестал","перестала","уже не","я не","не хочу"]

Special hobby update logic:
If the user mentions a specific game/activity related to an existing hobby
(e.g. “гта” when hobbies = “компьютерные игры”), use UPDATE:
{ "action":"UPDATE","fact_type":"hobbies","old_value":"компьютерные игры","new_value":"компьютерные игры, гта" }

If the message only confirms or repeats an existing hobby, return [] — do NOT add or update.

---

Examples:

User: "я не люблю компьютерные игры"
→ [{"action":"DELETE","fact_type":"hobbies"}]

User: "гта"
→ [{"action":"UPDATE","fact_type":"hobbies","old_value":"компьютерные игры","new_value":"компьютерные игры, гта"}]

User: "я ярослав"
→ [{"action":"ADD","fact_type":"name","value":"ярослав"}]

User: "Люблю играть в компьютерные игры"
→ []

User: "Я сейчас учусь"
→ [{"action":"ADD","fact_type":"learning","value":"учусь"}]"""

ROLLING_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that generates ultra-concise rolling conversation summaries.

Task:
Analyze the last 20 messages and produce a single short summary (1–2 sentences, max 30 words) that captures only:

Guidelines:
- Be extremely brief: no more than 30 words
- Ignore greetings, filler, or small talk

1. Main topics and themes of the day
2. Key facts, events, or updates about the user
3. Interests, preferences, or personal details revealed
4. Ongoing tasks, goals, or plans
5. Notable progress or changes compared to earlier summaries

- Use simple, factual sentences
- Do not speculate or add commentary
- Do not mention the assistant or the process of summarizing

Output:
