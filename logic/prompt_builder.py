GREETING DETECTION:
- Is this early conversation (first 3-5 messages)?
- Are there greeting patterns like "hello", "hi", "how are you", "привет", "здравствуйте"?
- Is the user just getting to know you?

CONVERSATION STAGE:
- Has rapport been established?
- Is the conversation flowing naturally?
- Is the user engaged and sharing?

MOOD & ENGAGEMENT:
- Is the user responsive and curious?
- Do they seem tired, distracted, or emotional?
- Is the topic light and casual?

TIMING RULES:
- SKIP if greetings or early conversation (build rapport first)
- SKIP if user seems disengaged or emotional
- ASK only when conversation is flowing naturally and user is engaged

Return only one word:
- "ASK" if perfect timing and mood for personal questions
- "SKIP" if greetings, too early, or mood/timing not right

# ================== DATABASE SERVICE PROMPTS ==================

FACT_UPDATE_PROMPT = """
You are a fact database manager.

Your role is to analyze a new user message and compare it against a list of existing facts.
Your goal is to determine which facts should be ADDED, UPDATED, or DELETED based on the user's intent.

# Action Definitions:
- ADD ? The user introduces a new fact that isn’t currently in the database.
- UPDATE ? The user refines or corrects an existing fact.
- DELETE ? The user negates or contradicts an existing fact.

# Output Format
Return ONLY a JSON array (no text before or after).
Each item must strictly match one of these schemas:
- { "action": "ADD", "fact_type": "string", "value": "string" }
- { "action": "UPDATE", "fact_type": "string", "old_value": "string", "new_value": "string" }
- { "action": "DELETE", "fact_type": "string" }

# Rules
- Be conservative: only output actions clearly supported by the message.
- Do not invent new facts.
- If a message implies the user no longer does or likes something ? DELETE.
- If a message introduces something new ? ADD.
- If a message replaces or corrects an old value ? UPDATE.

# Example
Existing Facts: [ { "fact_type": "interest_0", "value": "skiing" } ]
User's Message: "I don't do much skiing anymore, I've gotten really into hiking instead."

Expected JSON Output:
[
  { "action": "DELETE", "fact_type": "interest_0" },
  { "action": "ADD", "fact_type": "interest", "value": "hiking" }
]

ROLLING_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that generates ultra-concise rolling conversation summaries.

Task:
Analyze the last 20 messages and produce a single short summary (1–2 sentences, max 30 words) that captures only:
- Main topic(s) discussed
- Important facts, plans, or preferences the user revealed

Guidelines:
- Be extremely brief: no more than 30 words
- Ignore greetings, filler, or small talk
- Capture only the strongest, most relevant details
- Write in a neutral, factual tone
- Do not mention the assistant or summarizing

Output:
Return only the summary text, no extra formatting."""

DAILY_RECAP_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that generates a concise daily recap by merging multiple rolling summaries.

Task:
Analyze the provided conversation summaries and create one clear daily recap that captures:
1. Main topics and themes of the day
2. Key facts, events, or updates about the user
3. Interests, preferences, or personal details revealed
4. Ongoing tasks, goals, or plans
5. Notable progress or changes compared to earlier summaries

Guidelines:
- Keep it compact: 1–2 short paragraphs (max 120 words total)
- Focus only on meaningful details; ignore greetings or filler
- Use simple, factual sentences
- Do not speculate or add commentary
- Do not mention the assistant or the process of summarizing

Output:
Return only the recap text, with no extra formatting."""
