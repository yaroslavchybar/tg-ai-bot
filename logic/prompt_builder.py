"""

MOOD_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Recent conversation:
{conversation}

Analyze if this is a good time to ask a personal or profile question. Consider:

GREETING DETECTION:
- Is this early conversation (first 3-5 messages)?
- Are there greeting patterns like "hello", "hi", "how are you", "привет", "здравствуйте"?
- Is the user just getting to know you?

CONVERSATION STAGE:
- Has rapport been established?
- Is the conversation flowing naturally?
- Is the user engaged and sharing?

MOOD & ENGAGEMENT:
- Is the user responsive and curious?
- Do they seem tired, distracted, or emotional?
- Is the topic light and casual?

TIMING RULES:
- SKIP if greetings or early conversation (build rapport first)
- SKIP if user seems disengaged or emotional
- ASK only when conversation is flowing naturally and user is engaged

Return only one word:
- "ASK" if perfect timing and mood for personal questions
- "SKIP" if greetings, too early, or mood/timing not right

Response (ASK or SKIP):"""

FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that analyzes user messages to extract important personal information.

Your task is to identify and extract factual information that the user is sharing about themselves. Look for:

1. NAME: The user's name or what they want to be called
2. AGE: Their age or birth year
3. LOCATION: Where they live, work, or are from
4. INTERESTS: Hobbies, activities, sports, or things they like/enjoy
5. OTHER: Any other significant personal details

Return your analysis in this exact JSON format:
{
  "name": "extracted_name_or_null",
  "age": "extracted_age_or_null",
  "location": "extracted_location_or_null",
  "interests": ["interest1", "interest2", "interest3"],
  "other_facts": {"fact_key": "fact_value"}
}

Rules:
- Only extract information that is clearly and directly stated by the user
- If something is not mentioned, use null for single values or empty arrays/objects
- For interests, only include activities/hobbies that are genuinely interests (not just casual mentions)
- Be conservative - only extract information that is obviously personal information
- Ignore conversational filler, greetings, questions, etc.

Examples:
- "Hi, I'm John and I love playing football" → {"name": "John", "age": null, "location": null, "interests": ["football"], "other_facts": {}}
- "I live in New York and I'm 25 years old" → {"name": null, "age": "25", "location": "New York", "interests": [], "other_facts": {}}
- "Hello, how are you?" → {"name": null, "age": null, "location": null, "interests": [], "other_facts": {}}"""

ROLLING_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that generates concise conversation summaries.

Task:
Analyze the dialogue and produce a short summary (2–3 sentences) that captures:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Key events, decisions, or updates
3. Personal details, interests, or preferences the user revealed
4. Any ongoing tasks, goals, or plans mentioned

Guidelines:
- Limit to 2–3 sentences, factual and informative
- Ignore filler, greetings, or small talk
- Focus on concrete details and meaningful context
- Write in a neutral, objective tone
- Do not mention the assistant or refer to the act of summarizing

Output:
Return only the summary text with no extra formatting."""

DAILY_RECAP_PROMPT = """You are creating a comprehensive daily recap by consolidating multiple conversation summaries.

Analyze all the provided summaries and create one cohesive daily summary that captures:

1. Main topics and themes discussed throughout the day
2. Key events, decisions, or updates that occurred
3. Important personal information, interests, or preferences revealed
4. Any ongoing tasks, goals, or plans mentioned across conversations
5. Progress made toward goals or learning objectives
6. Patterns or recurring themes in the user's activities

Rules:
- Be comprehensive but concise (3-5 paragraphs maximum)
- Focus on meaningful content and progress
- Include specific facts, interests, and actionable items
- Write in a neutral, factual style
- Organize chronologically when possible
- Highlight connections between different conversation topics

Return only the consolidated summary text, structured in clear paragraphs."""
